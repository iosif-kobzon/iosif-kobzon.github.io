## About This Project
This project was orginally made for a private server. I recently found a **"paid"** loading screen, and I don't think we need to pay for that kind of script. All servers can have a cool and hype loading screen withouth paying for one. So I made one **free**.

I'm a French guy who loves to make web things for free. :)

You can donate to me if you would like to support me in my work [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WAAU3DKXJXFR6). ;)

You can also visit my website (under construction and a French site) [here](http://iklem.fr).

I promise this script will never be a **paid script**.
